My friends, freeze
and listen for directions.

00:33.740 --> 00:36.670
Hands in air, pencils
and highlighters down.

00:36.670 --> 00:45.560
I have heard some fabulous talk
between you and your partners.

00:45.560 --> 00:50.410
I want you to have a chance,
with your partners,

00:50.410 --> 00:54.760
to share some of that good
conversation with everyone else.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.960
I want you to gather
all of your things.

00:57.960 --> 01:04.600
You're going to drop off your
highlighter to me, on your way over.

01:04.600 --> 01:08.100
Bring all of your things to the rug.
