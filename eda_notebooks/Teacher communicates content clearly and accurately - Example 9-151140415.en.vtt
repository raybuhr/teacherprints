00:27.615 --> 00:29.049
Can you get your eyes ready?

00:29.049 --> 00:30.178
Yes.

00:30.178 --> 00:33.696
Okay. So first what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take a penny,

00:33.696 --> 00:35.344
and I want you to watch what happens

00:35.344 --> 00:37.204
to the penny when I put it
in the bucket of water.

00:37.204 --> 00:42.483
Are you ready?

00:42.483 --> 00:46.189
I want you to turn and talk to your
partner about what just happened.

00:46.189 --> 00:47.704
It sank.

00:47.704 --> 00:49.630
It's not buoyant.

00:49.630 --> 00:50.707
It's not buoyant.

00:50.707 --> 00:51.566
It sank.

00:51.566 --> 00:53.389
It's not buoyant.

00:53.389 --> 00:55.419
It's not buoyant.

00:55.419 --> 00:58.199
See, it stayed at the bottom
for a long time.

00:58.199 --> 01:00.959
It's not buoyant.

01:00.959 --> 01:03.161
It's a sink.
