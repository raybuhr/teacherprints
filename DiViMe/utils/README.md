# Utils

This folder contains utilities that are potentially useful to more than one tool in the ACLEW Diarization VM. It also contains some launchers that are in quarantine at present:
- noisemes_full.sh
- yuniSeg.sh

The end user should not need to deal with files in this folder, they are meant to be called by the "tools" that reside in the [DiViMe/launcher](https://github.com/srvk/DiViMe/tree/master/launcher) folder.
