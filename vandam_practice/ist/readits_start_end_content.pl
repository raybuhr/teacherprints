# This tool allows you to create new files with: 
# 1.) Child vocalization start and end times, as well as the duration of speech related (utt) and not speech related (cry);
# 2.) Adult vocalization start and end times; and 
# 3.) Child vocalization start and end times, as well as the duration of speech related (utt) and not speech related (cry) AND Adult vocalization start and end times

# Takes 6 command line arguments:
# 1: The (path and) file name of the input file. (e.g. "e20070225_191245_003110.its")
# 2: The (path and) file name of the child output file. (e.g. "e20070225_191245_003110_CHNStartEndUttCryTimes.txt")
# 3: The (path and) file name of the adult output file. (e.g. "e20070225_191245_003110_ANStartAndEndTimes.txt")
# 4: The (path and) file name of the combined child + adult output file. (e.g. "e20070225_191245_003110_CHN_AN_Segments.txt")
# 5: The mode for dealing with overlap: "IgnoreOverlap", "TreatOverlapAsAdult", "TreatOverlapAsChild", "DeleteOverlap", "IncludeOverlapExcludeIntervening", or "IncludeOverlapIgnoreIntervening" (recommended value is "IgnoreOverlap")
# 6: The maximum length the recording should be truncated at (in seconds). For a 16 hour recording, use 57600.

# Instructions:
# 1.) Open up a unix shell (e.g., the Terminal application under Utilities on Mac or Cygwin on Windows)
# 2.) Navigate to the directory where "readits_start_end_content.pl" is located (e.g. ~/Desktop/lena-its-tools/)
# 3.) Run readits_start_end_content.pl with the (path and) file name as the first argument, the (path and) file name of the child output file as the second argument;
#	  the (path and) file name of the adult output file as the third argument; the (path and) file name of the combine child and adult output file as the third argument;
#     the mode for dealing with the overlap as the fifth argument, and the maximum length the recording should be truncated at as the sixth argument;
#	  (e.g. perl readits_start_end_content. pl e20070225_191245_003110.its e20070225_191245_003110_CHNStartEndUttCryTimes.txt e20070225_191245_003110_ANStartAndEndTimes.txt e20070225_191245_003110_CHN_AN_Segments.txt "IgnoreOverlap" 57600)
